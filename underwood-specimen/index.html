    <h2>Type doesn’t just exist on page</h2>
    <h3>The dilemna.</h3>
    <p>After three months of designing, kerning, and re-kerning my newest typeface, Underwood, I was in need of a way to show it off. It looked great printed, and it looked wonderful on screen, but it wasn’t very intuitive to show it in both contexts. Enter the Underwood Font Specimen.</p>

    <h2>The Prototype</h2>
    <h3>You have to start somewhere.</h3>
    <p>The first weight of Underwood was an ornamental variant called Underwood Broken. What was unique about this weight was that, with a few tweaks, it could be laser cut. I made vector layouts in Adobe Illustrator and brought them into the laser cutting software, cut down my paper, and after a few minutes, my book was cut and ready for assembly. Using an Arduino Uno micro-controller board and copper tape, the book utilized capacitive sensing to gather touch input, and then produced results on screen.</p>

    <h2>Capacitive Sensing</h2>
    <h3>The down-and-dirty guide for non-engineers.</h3>
    <p>Capacitive sensing is the magic behind your touchscreen phone, and I harnessed its power in the simplest way here. The Arduino Uno board sends an electrical output signal which flows through the wire and copper tape, and then returns back through the input pin on the Arduino Uno board. This is a closed circuit and happens very, very quickly.</p>
    <p>When the user presses their finger on the strip of copper tape, the finger, which acts as a representative of the user’s natural body capacitance (our body’s own stored electrical charge), interrupts this flow. It then takes that charge longer to return to the input pin on the Arduino Uno board, and the software can detect this change. When it notices the lag in the return signal, it can signal an animation or state change or really anything that the coded computer software can respond to.</p>

    <h2>The Software</h2>
    <h3>Short and sweet.</h3>
    <p>Due to my familiarity with Java and it’s focus on the visual output, I chose Processing, a Java-like language, to build the software which accompanied the prototype. The program responded first when a user touched a given copper strip,  each strip with a unique input pin to tell the software which page the user was on. Then, an on-screen animation would play as long as the user was holding a finger on the screen. The trickiest part of this process is calibrating the software to match the proper level of sensitivity and timing.</p>

    <h2>The Underwood Font Specimen</h2>
    <h3>The real-deal.</h3>
    <p>After I laid out some initial plans, I began designing the layouts of the book and printed them on an inkjet printer. Because I wanted to showcase the entire Underwood type family, I had to abandon plans to laser cut the book as most of the weight were not suited for laser cutting. Then, I screen printed a thin coat of conductive ink onto a few pages. After some tests with my handy multimeter, I was able to verify the conductivity of the pages, and started assembling the specimen.</p>
    <p>The construction of the book was the most important to make this entire project functional. The first decision was to embed the micro-controller in the cover of the book. This would allow the book to function and look quite normal even if not plugged in. Note: because of my limited budget (no budget) I opted for a Teensy++ 2.0 which was very flat and had a mini-B USB cable, though I would have preferred a wireless board to avoid any cables all together. The second construction decision was my decision to use a Japanese stab-binding. This binding would allow me to use adhesive copper tape, wrapped around the spine of the book to attach to the back cover, where the micro-controller was embedded.</p>
    <p>After wrapping the covers in book cloth, wrapping the copper tape, soldering the resistors to the Teensy++ board, and finally clamping and binding the book together, it was fully functional. The user was able to flip through the book and simultaneously interact with the typeface on screen. The user could see the different weights increase and decrease in size, scroll through each character, and more. And all the user needs was the book, a USB cord, and a copy of the software.</p>
