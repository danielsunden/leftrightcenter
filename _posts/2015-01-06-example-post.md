Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on! I know what an erection feels like, Michael.

Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. And here you are coming out of your mother's third base! Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp.

No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break. But it wasn't. The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually.

Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. You want your belt to buckle, not your chair. Turn this skiff around! I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo.

I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. Let's see some bananas and nuts! I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON.

Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. You're Killing Me, Buster. Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt!

Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. If you don't start pulling your weight around here its going to be shape up, or…ship up. Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her. Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late.

She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪ Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Why are you squeezing me with your body? You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. NO TOUCHING!

I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. Daddy horny, Michael. Let's see some bananas and nuts! Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you. I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar.

Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.
